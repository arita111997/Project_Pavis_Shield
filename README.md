# project_Pavis_Shield
An open access archive where everyone can place their own documents, objects, among others 
The project aims to safeguard any type of archival collection in a safe place where it can be studied by others to benefit science.

It will have many aspects of safeguarding that will be developed until it has the prototype itself. In short it is a new type of secure open access archive. Created for everyone. To save our past history and our future history
